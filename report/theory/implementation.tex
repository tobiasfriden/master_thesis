\section{Obstacle avoidance}
To ensure low execution times it is crucial to use an efficient method of checking for collisions between states and $\xobst$. 
In this implementation, the S2Geometry library developed by Google was used \cite{s2geo}. This is a C++ library which contains 
efficient methods to index geometrical objects of any shape, and checking for collisions between different geometries such as points, lines and polygons. 

\section{Input set generation}
The input set $\inputs$ was generated using the approach described in Section \ref{sec:motion_prims_wind}. 
It was generated for wind directions $\psi_{w,s}=\{0\degree,20\degree,40\degree,\hdots,340\degree\}$ and desired final course changes
$\Delta\cog=\{20\degree,40\degree,\hdots,180\degree\}$, resulting in a total of 162 inputs for each specific $\windspd$. Symmetries of the system reduce the set of necessary inputs
as solutions for $\Delta\cog=\{-20\degree,-40\degree,\hdots,-180\degree\}$ are simply found by mirroring the $y_E$ coordinate of $u$.
The optimization problem was solved using \textabbr{nomad} \cite{nomad}, a C++ implementation of the \ac{mads} algorithm introduced in Section \ref{sec:solve_opt_ctrl}.
Cross-track error constraints were defined by $\lambda_d=25$ and $d_{\text{min}}=2.5$ m, \ac{cog} error $\Delta\psi=15\degree$ and wind variation $\delta_W=0.25$. The initial guess for $u$ 
was found by performing a grid search over the values
\begin{equation}
    \actions_{s,\text{init}}=\{(\Delta x_N,\Delta y_E): |\Delta x_N| \leq 300, 0\leq \Delta y_N \leq 300\}
\end{equation}
with a step size of 10 meters and selecting the input with the lowest value of the objective in Equation \eqref{eq:max_opt}.
Simulations of the closed-loop system for the generated inputs $u$, calculated for some different wind directions and $\windspd\in[3.75, 6.25]$ m/s, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:motion_prims}.

\section{State-space discretization}
To apply graph-search methods, the state-space has to be discretized. In this work the values of $x_N$ and $y_E$ were discretized into cells of size $d=10$ meters, and the 
heading $\psi$ was discretized in steps of $20\degree$. The Hybrid $A^*$ method presented in Section \ref{sec:hybrid-a-star} was used when sampling the state space, allowing continuous values of the state vector $x$ but assigning those to the closest 
discretized state.

\section{State expansions}
The step $\text{EXPAND}$ in Algorithm \ref{alg:astar} presented in Section \ref{sec:a-star} has to take both the wind direction $\winddir$ and the heading $\psi$ of $x$ into account. 
Since the inputs in $\inputs$ are generated using initial course $\cog=0$, it is first necessary to calculate the closest relative wind direction
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{w,\text{rel}}=\argmin_{\psi_{w,s}\in\{\psi_{w,s}\}}|(\psi-\winddir)-\psi_{w,s}|
\end{equation}
which is used to select the inputs for expansion. When mirroring inputs the wind direction also has to be mirrored, \ie\ 
$\tilde{\psi}_w=360\degree-\winddir$ is used to calculate $\psi_{w,\text{rel}}$. The selected inputs also have to be rotated, \ie\ the initial reference $u=(\Delta x_N, \Delta y_E)$ is transformed to 
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{u}=(\cos\psi \Delta x_N + \sin\psi \Delta y_E, -\sin\psi \Delta x_N + \cos\psi \Delta y_E)
\end{equation}
Finally, the expanded states and corresponding costs are found by simulating the closed-loop system \eqref{eq:closed_loop} using each selected $\tilde{u}$ as input. 
The actual wind direction $\winddir$ is used instead of $\psi_{w,s}$ in these simulations.

\subsection{Handling perpendicular winds}
A drawback of using straight line-segments as the control reference is that some inputs become problematic when the difference between 
$\psi$ and $\winddir$ is close to $90 \degree$. In this situation, expanding using an input which corresponds to a course change 
 of $\Delta\cog\approx180\degree$ might result in the trajectory controller choosing to fly in tailwind instead of headwind, leading to a large cross track error. This situation is 
 illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:hdg_diff_wind}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{fig/prim_diff_hdg}        
    \end{center}
    \caption{Large cross track error for $\Delta\cog\approx180\degree$ when the wind is perpendicular to \ac{uav} motion}
    \label{fig:hdg_diff_wind}
\end{figure}

This issue was mitigated by defining a set $\psi_{\text{safe}}$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{\text{safe}}=\{\psi: |\sin\psi|<\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\}
\end{equation}
If $|\psi-\winddir|\notin\psi_{\text{safe}}$ during expansion only inputs corresponding to $|\Delta\cog|\leq160\degree$ are used.

\section{Heuristic Lookup Table}
The \ac{hlut} was generated using the method in Algorithm \ref{alg:hlut} presented in section \ref{sec:hlut}, using the wind-direction $\winddir=0$. This implies that 
entries have to be generated for initial values of $\psi$ from $0\degree$ to $180\degree$ to cover all possible situations. To query a stored heuristic value $\tilde{h}(x, \tilde{x})$ it is 
thus necessary to rotate both $x$ and $\tilde{x}$ by the angle $\winddir$ in order for the query to align with the \ac{hlut}. 

The set of states for which to generate entries was selected as 
\begin{equation}
    \states=\{(x_N,y_E): |x_N|\leq D \cup |y_E| \leq D\}
\end{equation}
for $D=400$ m. To ensure that \ac{hlut} are entries are available for at least states within a smaller set with $D=200$ m, an additional 
$A^*$ search was performed for each such missing state after the initial generation. For $\windspd=5$ m/s the resulting \ac{hlut} consists of 951099 entries.

\section{Waypoint controller}
To send the calculated motion plan and landing sequence to the waypoint controller, these have to be converted to the 
MAVLink protocol which is supported by the ArduPlane autopilot \cite{mavlink}. This interface was implemented using the MAVROS 
plugin in \textabbr{ros} \cite{mavros}. \textabbr{ros} is a modular framework for robotics applications, with API:s available in both Python and C++ \cite{ros}.
