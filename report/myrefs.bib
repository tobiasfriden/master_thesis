abstract = "Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a heuristic search and optimisation technique inspired by natural evolution. They have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems of significant complexity. This paper is intended as an introduction to GAs aimed at immunologists and mathematicians interested in immunology. We describe how to construct a GA and the main strands of GA theory before speculatively identifying possible applications of GAs to the study of immunology. An illustrative example of using a GA for a medical optimal control problem is provided. The paper also includes a brief account of the related area of artificial immune systems."

   abstract = {Route planning for aircraft that should fly in hostile environmentscan be regarded as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the route should enable the aircraft to accomplish its mission tasks with a minimum risk exposure and minimum fuel consumption. This work compares different approaches for multi-objective route planning that have been suggested in the literature regarding their formulation of objectives as well as how they handle the decision maker’s preferences. It is concluded that most route planners minimize threat exposure and route length, but can also include altitude and flight dynamics constraints. Preferences regarding the objectives can be included in the route planning algorithms with weights or priorities. An alternative approach is that the route planner suggests a number of routes and thereafter lets the decision maker select the best one. },

Emphasis is placed on the need to find aesthetically pleasing curves in a wide range of circumstances; favorable results are obtained even when the knots are very unequally spaced or widely separated. The curves are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling, and the effects of a local change fall off exponentially as one moves away from the disturbed knot.",

abstract="This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.",
