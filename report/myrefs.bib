abstract = "Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a heuristic search and optimisation technique inspired by natural evolution. They have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems of significant complexity. This paper is intended as an introduction to GAs aimed at immunologists and mathematicians interested in immunology. We describe how to construct a GA and the main strands of GA theory before speculatively identifying possible applications of GAs to the study of immunology. An illustrative example of using a GA for a medical optimal control problem is provided. The paper also includes a brief account of the related area of artificial immune systems."

   abstract = {Route planning for aircraft that should fly in hostile environmentscan be regarded as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the route should enable the aircraft to accomplish its mission tasks with a minimum risk exposure and minimum fuel consumption. This work compares different approaches for multi-objective route planning that have been suggested in the literature regarding their formulation of objectives as well as how they handle the decision maker’s preferences. It is concluded that most route planners minimize threat exposure and route length, but can also include altitude and flight dynamics constraints. Preferences regarding the objectives can be included in the route planning algorithms with weights or priorities. An alternative approach is that the route planner suggests a number of routes and thereafter lets the decision maker select the best one. },

abstract="We present a system of interpolating splines with first-order and approximate second-order geometric continuity. The curves are easily computed in linear time by solving a diagonally dominant, tridiagonal system of linear equations. Emphasis is placed on the need to find aesthetically pleasing curves in a wide range of circumstances; favorable results are obtained even when the knots are very unequally spaced or widely separated. The curves are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling, and the effects of a local change fall off exponentially as one moves away from the disturbed knot.",
