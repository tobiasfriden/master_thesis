\begin{acknowledgments}
I would like to begin by thanking my co-founder of Airpelago and supervisor Fredrik Falkman. 
Without your hard work and visionary mindset the past years, neither Airpelago nor this thesis project would exist.

At Linköping University, I would like to thank my supervisors Jonatan Olofsson and Kristoffer Bergman. You have been a 
constant source of valuable feedback and suggestions. I would also like to thank my examiner Daniel Axehill for always being open to 
new ideas and helping me setting a reasonable scope for this thesis.

Last but definitely not least, I would like to thank my family and friends. Without your constant support,
this thesis would not have been possible. A special thanks to all the people that I've shared the last years in Linköping with. 
You have made my university studies a real highlight of my life so far!
